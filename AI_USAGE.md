## Prompts:

1. Analyze above requirements and give me a step by step checklist to build this project please.
2. explain to me how i can improve this code. is it modular and production ready ?
3. my approach seems to be very slow and needs to fetch the weather data for each and every property returned by the db is there any better way to do this ?
4. what is node cache and p limit ? explain with examples please
5. do a code review on my code and suggest all improvements
6. i have implemented pagination but there seems to be an issue. i fetch some data lets say 20 so now the page size is 20 and the frontend expects 20 records but i have to filter them with weather after fetching so there is a chance that out of 20 some may not pass the weather filters or also a chance where some pages would be fully empty is there any way to fix this in a efficient way. the solution must be efficient.

Note: these are the main prompts i have not included some of the smaller prompts i used to debug stuff
